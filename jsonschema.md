### JSON-schema

The metadata tables below have a resultant-counterpart inside [json_schema/](json_schema/).
The json-schema and scripts in there implement what's being discussed below.

The schema we're using here come from a package-validator based on json-schema, prototyped for Planmap packages:
[github.com/planmap-eu/package_validator](https://github.com/planmap-eu/package_validator/tree/v1/json_schema).
